### Exercise 1

1. You have a GifListFunctionalComponent in the project you have to change it to a class component.
### Exercise 2

The goal of this challenge is to re-code from scratch (don't cheat!) the Giphy Dog Search app from the lecture. Use functional components.
#### Features

1. All the gifs should appear in the right side of the page.
2. When a user types a query, the list of Gifs should display the gif list in the `gifData.js` file.
3. When a user clicks on a gif from the list, it should appear on the main scene on the left.
4. (Optional) When a user focuses in / out of the input, find a nice way to twist the UI on the left part (opacity, background-color, border...) to show your user he's in / out of the input!

#### Guidelines

- First, identify the components you need in your App. Use `ex2.png` image you have in the repo.
- Then, think about the data and design their `props` / `state`
- Finally, add events / callbacks

#### More practice

- Try to implement it in class components.
